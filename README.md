# EscapePierito
My Bachelor's Thesis project developed under supervision of prof. Ing. Jiří Žára, CSc., the head of Department of Computer Graphics and Interaction at CTU FEE.

For the purpose of my Bachelor's Thesis I developed a two player escape room game using Augmented reality for Android devices. This game is unique by implementing multiplayer puzzles which require both players to cooperate in Augmented reality. The game was created in Unity Game Engine.

The Unity Project of the game and the video from the gameplay are available here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lmnUHu30EKi3m3DyJ2730zkQHKB425pv?usp=drive_link

The main scene of the Unity Project can be found in Assets/ExampleAssets/Scenes/EscapePierito
